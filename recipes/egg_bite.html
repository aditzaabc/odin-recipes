    <h2>10 Egg Bite Recipes to Make for Breakfast</h2>
    <p>Whether you fell in love with egg bites at Starbucks over the past few years or are ready to discover them now, it's time to add these genius protein-packed breakfasts to your morning routine. For one, they're easier than "regular" eggs for breakfast: Instead of cooking them on the stovetop or poaching in boiling water, this recipe simplifies things and cooks a dozen eggs at once in a muffin tin. Baking at low temperature gives them a soft, frittata-like texture that can be reheated without the risk of overcooking. They're fuss-free and perfect for adding in whatever ingredients you have on hand. And they're versatile: You can serve egg bites between toasted English muffins, on top of buttered toast, or all by themselves for a quick on-the-go breakfast.</p>
    <p>Whether you stick with the base recipe, below, or try any (or all!) of our 10 variations, see how egg bites are here to make your weekday breakfasts a tasty snap.</p>
    <h3>Tips for Making Ahead and Storing Egg Bites</h3>
    <p>These egg bites are a great option for meal prepping. You can bake off a batch and stash them in zip-top bags in the fridge for up to a week. The egg bites are delicious served warm or at room temperature making them a great option for workday lunches.</p>
    <p>You can also freeze cooked egg bites and store them for several months. Here's what to do: After baking, let your egg bites cool completely, then transfer them onto a parchment-lined sheet pan and freeze them for one hour. Once frozen, transfer the egg bites into a zip-top bag and stash them in the freezer. When ready to eat, just microwave the egg bites for 30 to 60 seconds until warmed or let them defrost in the fridge overnight if eating at room temperature or packing for work.</p>

    <h3>Breakfast Egg Bites (Base Recipe)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Prep: 5 mins</li>
        <li>Cook: 30 mins</li>
        <li>Total: 35 mins</li>
        <li>Servings: 12</li>
        <li>Yield: 12 mini egg cups</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick pan spray</li>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk (whole, skim, or 2%)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Generously spray the wells of a 12-cup standard muffin tin with nonstick pan spray.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the milk, salt, and pepper. Whisk until the mixture is homogeneous and there are no streaks of unincorporated egg whites.</li>
        <li>Evenly distribute the mixture into the wells of the muffin tin filling them about three-fours of the way to the top (about 1/4 cup per well). Bake until the egg bites puff up and the tops no longer look wet, 25 to 30 minutes. (The egg bites will puff dramatically in the oven but collapse once cooled.)</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly, then remove the egg bites from the tin using an offset spatula or butter knife. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Egg Bite Recipe Variations</h2>
    <p>The best thing about egg bites is that you can customize them by adding whatever ingredients you have on hand. You can add chopped veggies for added fiber or sausage or bacon for some additional protein. (Just avoid adding wet ingredients like sauces or grated zucchini; they can make your egg bites soggy.)</p>
    <p>This is your blank canvas - experiment however you like! But if you'd like a head start, try these 10 variations that require 5 ingredients or less.</p>
